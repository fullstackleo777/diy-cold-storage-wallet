# Virtual Machine as Air Gapped Computer Bad Idea

Deploying an air-gapped computer inside a VM on your internet-connected computer defeats the entire point of air-gapping.

## üö´ Why This Is a Bad Idea

1. **No true isolation**
A virtual machine (VM) running on an internet-connected host **shares the same hardware** (CPU, RAM, sometimes disk). If the host is compromised, **the VM is compromised**. Attackers can bypass that "air gap" with side-channel attacks, hypervisor vulnerabilities, or VM escape exploits.

2. **You're still on the grid**
Even if the VM doesn‚Äôt have a virtual NIC (network card), your host OS does. Malware on your main system could **monitor, copy, or interact with the VM**, completely breaking the air-gap model.

3. **Physical air gaps require physical separation**
The essence of air-gapping is **no physical or wireless path to a network**. A VM doesn‚Äôt count ‚Äî it's like saying a jail cell in your living room is still secure when the whole house is compromised.

### ‚úÖ What You Should Do Instead

To **properly air-gap** a computer, follow this setup:

| Feature                   | True Air-Gapped Setup              |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Separate hardware**     | Yes ‚Äì different physical computer  |
| **No network interfaces** | Remove or disable Wi-Fi/Ethernet   |
| **No USB unless scanned** | Use write-once media or secure USB |
| **No shared peripherals** | No shared keyboard, mouse, drives  |
| **No virtualization**     | Bare metal OS install only         |


### ‚ö†Ô∏è Real-World Use Case Example (Crypto Relevance)

If you‚Äôre planning to:

* **Sign crypto transactions offline** (e.g., with GPG, Bitcoin Core, or hardware wallets)
* **Store cold wallet private keys**
* **Generate seed phrases securely**

Then a **physically isolated machine** is **mandatory**.

### üõ°Ô∏è Pro Tip

For offline crypto setups, use:

* A low-cost laptop or Raspberry Pi
* Linux OS with verified checksum from a clean download (e.g., Tails, Ubuntu)
* Boot from a **Live USB** if you don't want to install
* Sign transactions offline ‚Üí transfer via QR code or USB only when needed (with strict hygiene)
