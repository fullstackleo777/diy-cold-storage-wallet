# Create a Metal Seed Backup

## 🔩 Metal Backup for Seed Phrases – Step-by-Step

### 🔧 What You Need

* A **metal backup kit** (e.g., Cryptosteel, Billfodl, or DIY steel plate).
* A **manual stamping kit** or letter punch.
* Your **wallet’s seed phrase**.

### 🪜 Steps

1. **Write Down Seed Phrase:**

   * Ensure your seed phrase is correct (12 or 24 words).
   * Double-check it against wallet software.

2. **Prepare Metal Backup:**

   * Organize words or letters into the backup plate.
   * Use a hammer and punch to permanently mark the metal.
   * If using tile-based backups (like Billfodl), slide in the correct letter tiles.

3. **Test Recovery:**

   * Try recovering a wallet using your backup (optional, highly recommended).

4. **Store Safely:**

   * Place in a **fireproof safe**, hidden location, or multiple geographic sites.

## 🔐 Security Tips

* **Always verify wallet software** with PGP signatures if possible.
* **Never store private keys or seeds digitally** on internet-connected devices.
* **Label nothing as “Crypto Wallet”** to avoid theft if discovered.
* **Consider Shamir Backup** for splitting a seed among trusted parties (e.g., 2 of 3 needed to recover).
