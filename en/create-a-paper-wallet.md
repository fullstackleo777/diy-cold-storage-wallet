# Create a Paper Wallet

## 🧻 Paper Wallet – Step-by-Step

### 🔧 What You Need

* Access to **BitAddress.org** or similar (downloaded ahead of time).
* **Paper** and a **safe** or fireproof container.

### 🪜 Steps

   * Download the **HTML file** version of the tool.
   * Transfer to USB.

2. **Air-Gap Your PC:**

   * Use a clean, offline machine or boot from a **fresh Linux USB**.
   * Disable all network connections permanently.

3. **Generate Wallet:**

   * Open the HTML wallet generator file on the air-gapped PC.
   * Move your mouse or type random characters to generate entropy.
   * Save or print the generated wallet **ONLY with an offline printer**.

4. **Secure the Printout:**

   * Do **NOT** take pictures or screenshots.

* **Label nothing as “Crypto Wallet”** to avoid theft if discovered.
* **Consider Shamir Backup** for splitting a seed among trusted parties (e.g., 2 of 3 needed to recover).
